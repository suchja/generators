# About

Describes how to build and run the tinkerforge language bindings in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container.

## Goal

In general I see the following goals for this activity:

-	Support Tinkerforge team in improving their build and development process. This could also help developers from the community participating in improving Tinkerforge components.
-	Support users of Tinkerforge by making it easier to create, test and deploy Tinkerforge based applications.
-	Personally it is a learning/practise project for better understanding Docker for technical applications.
