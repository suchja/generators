# General Introduction to Docker container for the TF language bindings

Why is it a good idea to use docker for the tinkerforge language bindings? I see the following use cases:

1.	Have an easy to use development environment which can be quickly setup on any machine running Docker.
2.	Have an build environment which can be used with (m)any continuous integration and deployment plattform.
3.	Have an deployment environment, which lets you use and test any version and variant of the language binding.
